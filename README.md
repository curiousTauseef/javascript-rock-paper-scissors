# A Simple Rock-Paper-Scissors JavaScript Demo

At the October meeting of the [Santa Cruz Women's Javascript/FrontEnd Development Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Santa-Cruz-Womens-Javascript-FrontEnd-Development-Meetup/), one member was demonstrating some browser debugging techniques, using a JavaScript rock-paper-scissors project she had done as an example. This led to some enthusiastic talk about everyone (who wanted to) writing their own simple JavaScript rock-paper-scissors projects to show at November's meeting, just to see all the different UI/coding approaches people would take.

This was my contribution, and I don't have too much to say about it other than that I decided to use unicode characters rather than text or images just because I imagined that there would be some reasonable unicode characters out there that I could use to represent rock, paper, and scissors, and was curious to see what I would find.
